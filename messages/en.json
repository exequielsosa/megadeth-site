The name comes from a political pamphlet that Mustaine found discarded on that return bus: the pamphlet read the phrase \"We can't get rid of the megadeath arsenal, regardless of how peace treaties evolve\". Mustaine liked the word Megadeath (which in English designates a million nuclear deaths) but removed the second \"a\", creating Megadeth as a symbol of annihilation of the established order."

He and Ellefson auditioned dozens of drummers unsuccessfully; they even briefly featured Kerry King from Slayer as second guitarist in some local shows, a collaboration that showed the early fraternity of the thrash scene. They finally recruited jazz-fusion drummer Gar Samuelson and guitarist Chris Poland in late 1984, musicians who would bring technical complexity and sophistication to the brutal sound Mustaine sought. With Mustaine also handling vocals (unable to find a suitable singer), the quartet began composing material of extremely high speed and technical complexity that would raise the standards of emerging thrash metal."

Mustaine signed with Combat Records, an independent label that offered them $8,000 to record their first album. The budget quickly vanished on drugs, alcohol and fun, reflecting the young group's unrestrained lifestyle. After firing the original producer, Megadeth finished producing the album themselves with lo-fi quality, but still their debut Killing Is My Business… and Business Is Good! (1985) became an underground metal success. The album, released in summer 1985, showed ferocious technique that raised the standard of emerging thrash metal. It included \"Mechanix\", a song that Mustaine had composed in Metallica and that band re-recorded (slower) as \"The Four Horsemen\" on Kill 'Em All, marking one of Dave's first musical revenges. It also featured the first appearance of Vic Rattlehead, Megadeth's now famous skull mascot, on the cover. With aggressive and fast songs, Killing Is My Business... put Megadeth on the map and got them a contract with the giant Capitol Records for their next release."

Their second album, Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?

The album presented a more mature and technically superior sound to their debut, with complex riffs and virtuoso solos that would define Megadeth's distinctive style. The single \"Peace Sells\" featured a video aired on MTV that became iconic: it showed Vic Rattlehead in front of the ruins of the United Nations, an image that perfectly captured the rebellious and political spirit of eighties metal. The MTV exposure was crucial for expanding their audience beyond the underground."

After the Peace Sells album tour, Mustaine made the difficult decision to fire Poland and Gar Samuelson for their severe drug dependencies, even accusing them of selling band equipment to finance their destructive habits. The situation had reached an unsustainable point where addiction surpassed any professional commitment. It was late 1987 and Megadeth was losing two key members –architects of the sound that had led them to success– just as their fame was growing exponentially."

This urgency marked both the strengths and weaknesses of the result. So Far, So Good... So What! (1988) emerged as a furious and raw album, with flashes of genuine brilliance –like \"In My Darkest Hour\", an emotional and melancholic piece that Mustaine composed after learning of Cliff Burton's death from Metallica, showing a more introspective facet– but also reflecting the chaos in its rushed production. Among the songs stood out a frantic and accelerated cover of \"Anarchy in the U.K.\" by the Sex Pistols, which perfectly captured the destructive spirit of the moment the band was living."

In summer 1988, Megadeth achieved massive exposure by participating in the prestigious Monsters of Rock festival at Donington Park (England) in front of more than 100,000 people, sharing the bill with giants like Iron Maiden, Kiss and Guns N' Roses. It was a golden opportunity to consolidate their international status, but internal chaos continued to grow. Immediately after the festival, in an impulsive decision that exemplified his deteriorated mental state, Mustaine also fired Behler and Young, abruptly canceling the scheduled tour they had for Australia and leaving the band dismantled again in the middle of their success."

By the end of 1988, Megadeth was practically destroyed by excesses: Mustaine was facing his addiction in clinic, the lineup was incomplete again and the band's future was completely uncertain. The years of success had been eclipsed by self-destruction. However, from that total chaos would emerge the most important reinvention in Megadeth's history. In 1989, now more sober and determined, Mustaine met the extraordinarily talented guitarist Marty Friedman –former virtuoso of the neoclassical metal band Cacophony– and decided to integrate him into the band after considering several candidates (among them none other than Dimebag Darrell from Pantera). Together with Nick Menza (former drum tech of the band who knew the repertoire perfectly, promoted to official drummer after demonstrating his talent during Chuck's departure), Megadeth prepared for what would be their most successful reinvention. Fresh out of rehabilitation and with a renewed lineup that combined experience and technical virtuosity, Mustaine entered the studio in mid-1990 with fierce determination and recovered mental clarity. The result would be historic."

With the virtuoso duo Mustaine–Friedman on guitars, Ellefson's power on bass and Nick Menza's devastating technique on drums, Rust in Peace delivered complex and emblematic tracks like \"Holy Wars... The Punishment Due\" and \"Hangar 18\", which showed a more precise Megadeth in a state of creative grace."

Songs like \"Symphony of Destruction\", \"Sweating Bullets\" and \"Countdown to Extinction\" became metal anthems of the 90s and dramatically expanded the band's audience beyond traditional thrash. Countdown... presented a somewhat more accessible and polished sound, without sacrificing fury or critical content (the title track denounces the slaughter of animal species). The band filmed popular videos that dominated MTV and carried out a massive world tour in stadiums and festivals, playing alongside groups like Pantera and Suicidal Tendencies. By this time Megadeth had already accumulated six consecutive Gold/Platinum albums in the US, confirming that their success was sustained and not a fluke. Mustaine and his companions received media praise and even got involved in high-profile events, such as when Dave was an MTV correspondent at the 1992 Democratic Convention, showing that Megadeth had completely transcended the underground metal sphere to become cultural icons."

Released on Halloween 1994, Youthanasia (with cover showing elderly women hanging babies on a clothesline) caused visual impact and sold very well, featuring standout tracks like \"Train of Consequences\" and the ballad \"À Tout Le Monde\". Although some fans missed the speed of previous works, Megadeth showed their versatility without losing their edge. The album was certified Platinum and their world tour took them to South America for the first time in late 1994, where they played to passionate crowds who received them as true rock stars. In 1995 they released the EP Hidden Treasures, compiling songs previously scattered across soundtracks (like \"Angry Again\" from the film Last Action Hero and the cover \"Paranoid\" by Black Sabbath), demonstrating the consistent quality of their material. That same year, they headlined the prestigious Monsters of Rock in Argentina and Brazil alongside legends like Alice Cooper and Ozzy Osbourne, definitively confirming their place at the top of world metal and their ability to lead massive festivals."

That year they released Cryptic Writings, an album that continued the more accessible path and even boldly flirted with modern hard rock. The single \"Trust\" became their most successful radio song, reaching #5 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart (their highest position on that chart to date). Cryptic Writings was quickly certified Gold, also driven by other standout tracks like \"Almost Honest\" and \"Secret Place\". The band won the 1997 Metal Edge Readers' Choice award for Best Live Band, reflecting their powerful stage performance that remained impeccable. However, beneath the surface of success there were worrying signs of internal problems: during the Cryptic Writings tour, drummer Nick Menza discovered a tumor in his knee that required immediate surgery and had to abruptly abandon the tour. Mustaine, always fearing for the group's stability after so many past changes, made the controversial decision to replace Menza permanently instead of waiting for him. In July 1998 he announced the incorporation of drummer Jimmy DeGrasso (ex Alice Cooper, Suicidal Tendencies), marking the first lineup change in the successful nineties era and anticipating a more unstable phase to come. Shortly after, Marty Friedman began to openly express his growing discontent with the more commercial musical direction the band was taking, sowing the seeds of future creative tensions."

Risk (produced by Dann Huff) contained singles like \"Crush 'Em\" –designed to sound in sports stadiums– and softer ballads, moving away from the traditional aggressive sound. The reception was mixed to negative; although it sold decently and reached Gold status, Risk is remembered as Megadeth's most controversial album."

This album sought to recover the band's classic heavy tone following the criticism of Risk. With Mustaine again in charge of almost all compositions, World Needs a Hero offered tracks like \"Moto Psycho\" and \"Dread and the Fugitive Mind\", which, while not reaching the brilliance of the classics, did show Megadeth attempting to revitalize their metal identity. During 2001 they toured more modestly, but very memorably in certain places. They also released their first live album 'Rude Awakening'. The album was planned to be recorded live at a concert in Argentina, but due to the September 11 attacks in 2001, the band decided to record it live in the United States. The album was a total rejection of much of Megadeth's softer material (like the Risk album, from which no tracks were included) and was seen as a return to their heavier days of the 80s and early 90s. (Much of the chosen material, if not all, was selected by fans who voted for them on Megadeth.com)."

Unable to play guitar temporarily and facing an uncertain recovery, Mustaine decided to dissolve Megadeth. The separation announcement took the metal world by surprise. David Ellefson, the co-founding bassist, also stepped away (not without first initiating legal action against Mustaine in royalty disputes, which cooled their relationship for a while). The live album Rude Awakening –recorded shortly before– was released in 2002 as a farewell to fans, capturing the band's power live in their last shows of that era."

In 2004, with renewed faith (Mustaine had become a devout Christian during this period and abandoned excesses), he decided to resurrect Megadeth –initially conceived as a solo project, but finally using the band name for its historical weight. That year The System Has Failed (2004) was released, an album that marked a true rebirth. Recorded with session musicians –including former guitarist Chris Poland as a guest on solos–, The System Has Failed was acclaimed as the best Megadeth album in many years, with sharp songs like \"Kick the Chair\" and \"Die Dead Enough\" that recalled the nineties glory."

With this lineup, Megadeth embarked on the Blackmail the Universe Tour (2004-2005), proving they were back. In parallel, Mustaine founded his own traveling festival that year, Gigantour, bringing together legendary and new metal bands to tour together. The first edition in 2005 included Dream Theater, Nevermore, Anthrax and, of course, Megadeth as headliners. Mustaine established himself as a visionary curator of the metal community, carefully selecting a lineup that ranged from respected veterans to new genre promises. The second edition in 2006 expanded its reach with Lamb of God, Opeth, Arch Enemy and Overkill, demonstrating Mustaine's commitment to stylistic diversity within metal. The Gigantour concept revolutionized the way metal bands could collaborate and promote the genre, establishing a legacy that would influence future traveling festivals."

With Glen and Shawn Drover plus LoMenzo, Megadeth recorded United Abominations (2007) under the Roadrunner label. This album returned to political-social themes (Mustaine openly criticized the United Nations in the title song) and featured interesting collaborations, such as guest vocals by Cristina Scabbia (Lacuna Coil) on a new version of \"À Tout Le Monde\". United Abominations received positive reviews and placed in the Billboard Top 10, a sign that the band maintained relevance. The 2007-08 world tour was successful, but again there were changes: in early 2008, Glen Drover retired, claiming he wanted to dedicate more time to his family and certain personal dissatisfaction."

Songs like \"Head Crusher\" and \"This Day We Fight!\" showed a furious Mustaine, inspired by contemporary socio-political themes. Endgame received praise for its ferocity –even Dave Ellefson commented that it reminded him of the aggressiveness of Rust in Peace–. Commercially it placed Top 10 in several countries. After its release, something happened that followers longed for: in February 2010, David Ellefson (after reconciling with Mustaine after years of estrangement) returned to Megadeth's bass. Shawn Drover contacted Ellefson when he learned that LoMenzo was planning to leave, and Mustaine and Ellefson took the opportunity to leave old grudges behind. Thus, at the close of the 2000s decade, Megadeth reinvented itself again, combining new blood (Broderick, Shawn) with the classic Mustaine–Ellefson chemistry."

In one fell swoop, Mustaine and Ellefson were left alone at the helm of the group (for the second time in history, the first was in 2002). Far from being discouraged, Mustaine saw this as an opportunity for renewal. 2015 brought high-caliber reinforcements: Kiko Loureiro, virtuoso Brazilian guitarist from the band Angra, officially joined Megadeth, bringing his technical mastery and fresh air to composition."

With this powerful lineup, Megadeth recorded Dystopia (2016). The resulting album was acclaimed as a triumphant return to aggressive and complex thrash. Songs like \"The Threat Is Real\", \"Fatal Illusion\" and the title track \"Dystopia\" showed Mustaine inspired by dystopian themes and devastating riffs, while Kiko Loureiro contributed melodic solos and exquisite arrangements. Dystopia totally revitalized Megadeth's image and received numerous awards. In fact, at the 59th Grammy Awards (2017), Megadeth finally won their first Grammy after 12 previous nominations, taking home the trophy for Best Metal Performance for the song \"Dystopia\". When Mustaine went on stage to collect the Grammy, the ceremony's house band unusually played Metallica's \"Master of Puppets\" as background music, to which Dave reacted with humor by air guitaring while smiling. The much-commented moment ironically symbolized Metallica's long shadow in Mustaine's history, but now he finally had a Grammy with Megadeth's name engraved on it."

It was a painful decision given their long shared history, but Mustaine declared it was for the good of the group. To complete the nearly finished new album, Mustaine called on bassist Steve Di Giorgio (Testament) as a session musician and removed the tracks recorded by Ellefson.

The album addresses dark themes (plagues, war, corruption) very much in line with recent pandemic times. Musically it combines the virtuosity of Loureiro and Verbeuren with Mustaine's unmistakable aggression. Standout tracks include \"We'll Be Back\", \"Night Stalkers\" (with a cameo by rapper Ice-T) and \"Soldier On!\". The Sick, the Dying... received positive reviews and proved that, at almost 60 years old, Mustaine was still \"enjoying his work\" and sounding revitalized. The album debuted in the Billboard 200 Top 5, standing as another late commercial success for the band.

The emotional reunion with Friedman was repeated in August 2023 at the Wacken Open Air festival in Germany, where Marty again played alongside Megadeth on four songs (including \"Holy Wars\" and \"Trust\") to a massive ovation.

    "description": "Netflix has officially confirmed a 16-episode miniseries, Dave Mustaine: Strings of Fire, chronicling the rise, rupture, reinvention, and enduring legacy of the metal icon.\n\nDirected and narrated by Mustaine himself, the series takes viewers on an uncompromising journey: from a restless youth and early band confrontations to the founding of Megadeth, worldwide thrash metal domination, and a career defined by precision, intensity, and survival.\n\n\"This story isn't just about metal,\" Mustaine says. \"It's about discipline: turning anger into structure, chaos into control, and noise into meaning.\"\n\nEach episode traces his evolution, from ambitious outsider to one of the most influential figures in heavy music history. The series doesn't shy away from harsh truths: the setbacks that became fuel, the conflicts that forged clarity, and the relentless pursuit of excellence that demanded accountability at every turn.\n\nStrings of Fire delves into the creation of Mustaine's most iconic work, from the sharp urgency of \"Peace Sells\" and the geopolitical fury of \"Holy Wars… The Punishment Due\", to the epic force of \"Symphony of Destruction\". It explores his obsession with tempo, technique, and lyrical precision, and how those standards transformed metal's DNA.\n\nCombining unreleased archival footage, unheard demos, personal reflections, and cinematic recreations, the series offers an unprecedented look into the mind of a musician who demanded more: from his bandmates, from his audience, and from himself.",

    "title": "Dave Mustaine Reveals Hand Condition Accelerating Retirement",
    "description": "In a new interview with our colleagues at Mariskal Rock (via Blabbermouth.net), Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine discussed the moment he decided to announce his retirement, which will be extended over time with a final tour once the band releases their final self-titled album. This led the former Metallica guitarist to reveal that he suffers from a hand condition that has shortened his career.\n\n\"No. No, because I only mentioned it. I didn't decide it. We were working in the studio [on the upcoming self-titled Megadeth album] and it had been some very difficult weeks. We were trying to finish everything and, obviously, for us it was important to make sure the album turned out well. We had a lot of deadlines to meet, which made it difficult and things like that. And my hands were hurting a lot. So one day I told my manager: 'I don't know how much longer I'm going to be able to keep doing this.' I didn't tell him: 'Hey, I want to retire right now.'\"\n\nAnd what's wrong with his hand that doesn't allow him to play at 100%? Mustaine explains it this way: \"Yes, you can see it here, on this hand. There's a line right there that sticks out. It's something called Dupuytren's contracture, and it will make my finger bend like this. It's already started, it's curving a little bit. And if you look at my fingertips, they're very arthritic. So all those bumps make it very painful for me to play.\"\n\nFor now, Dave won't be going under the knife and the reason is clear: \"I'm going to wait until I'm ready to try it, because if I try it now and I'm at 95%, and they operate on me and that sets me back, it would have been a bad decision. If I wait until my hands cause me problems and I try it and it doesn't work, well, then I'll have toured everywhere, I'll have said goodbye to everyone and I won't leave anything unsaid or unfinished.\"",
